# Investigating a Phishing Domain with Chronicle

## üìå Project Overview
At a financial services company, I investigated a phishing email received by an employee. The email contained a suspicious domain: **signin.office365x24.com**. Using **Chronicle**, I determined whether other employees had received similar emails and if they had interacted with the domain.
